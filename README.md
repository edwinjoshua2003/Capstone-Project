# Capstone-Project
Drug Recommendation System using GPT, BioBERT

The objective of this paper is to develop a robust and efficient drug recommendation system leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). By integrating these models into a web application using Flask, we aim to provide healthcare professionals with a user-friendly platform for generating personalized drug recommendations based on patient information and medical histories.
